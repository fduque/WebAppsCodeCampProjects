        <p>Locke studied medicine, natural sciences and philosophy at Oxford, mainly the works of Bacon and Descartes. In 1683, he took refuge in the Netherlands when he was accused of treason along with his political mentor Lord Shaftesbury who was leader of the opposition to King Charles II in parliament. He returned to England when William of Orange ascended the throne in 1688. In 1689-1690 he published his first works: Letters on Tolerance, Essay on Human Understanding, and the Two Treatises on Civil Government. He died on October 28, 1704, at the age of 72.
Locke never married or had children. He is buried in All Saints Churchyard, High Laver, Essex in England. </p>

       Locke's political philosophy is based on the notion of government consented, by the governed, of constituted authority and respect for the natural right of the human being - to life, freedom and property. Modern liberal revolutions, therefore, are influenced by the English Revolution, the American Revolution, and the initial phase of the French Revolution, offering them a justification for the revolution and the form of the new government. Locke is usually included among the British empiricists, alongside David Hume and George Berkeley, mainly for his work on epistemological issues. In political science, usually is classified in the school of the natural right or jusnaturalismo.
His ideas helped to overthrow absolutism in England. Locke said that all men, at birth, had natural rights - right to life, liberty, and property. To secure these natural rights, men had created governments. If these governments, however, did not respect life, liberty, and property, the people had the right to revolt against them.

        Locke is considered the protagonist of empiricism, which states that all knowledge and learning flows from experience. He presents a critique of innate ideas through the theory of the tabula rasa ... With this theory Locke states that the human being is born a "blank sheet", and is shaped by experiences, attempts and mistakes.
So according to Locke Empiricism seeks to understand things in a methodological, systematic and critical way. This thought presented by Locke resembles that of the thinker Niccolo Machiavelli when he refers to Verit√† effetuale (The Effective Truth of Things), which is about analyzing things as they really are.
In the Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Locke argues that experience is the source of knowledge, which then develops through the effort of reason. Another notable philosophical work is Thoughts on the Education, published in 1693. The main sources of the thought of Locke are: scholastic nominalismo, whose center was Oxford; the English empiricism of the time; the rationalism defended by Rene Descartes and the philosophy of Malebranche.
